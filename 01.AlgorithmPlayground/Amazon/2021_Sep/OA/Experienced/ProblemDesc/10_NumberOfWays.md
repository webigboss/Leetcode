The Amazon Kindle Store is an online e-book store where readers can choose a book from a wide range of categories. It also provides the ability to bookmark pages the user wishes to return to later. A book is represented as a binary string having two types of pages:

'0': an ordinary page
'1': a bookmarked page

Find the number of ways to select 3 pages in ascending index order such that no two adjacent selected pages are of the same type.

Example

book = '01001'

The following sequences of pages match the criterion:

[1, 2 ,3], that is, 01001 → 010.
[1, 2 ,4], that is, 01001 → 010.
[2, 3 ,5], that is, 01001 → 101.
[2, 4 ,5], that is, 01001 → 101.

The answer is 4.

Function Description

Complete the function numberOfWays in the editor below.

numberOfWays has the following parameter:

string book: a string that represents the pages of the book
Returns

long: the total number of ways to select 3 pages that meet the criterion
Constraints

1 ≤ | book | ≤ 2 · 105
Each character in book is either '0' or '1'.

Sample Output

0
Explanation

It is not possible to pick a sequence of 3 pages that satisfies the conditions.

The Inicial Code
```
public class Result {
/* Complete the 'numberOfWays' function below
* The function is expected to return a LONG_INTEGER
* The function accepts STRING book as parameter
*/

public static long numberOfWays(String book) {
    
}

}
